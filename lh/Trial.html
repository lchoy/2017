Tacocat backwards is still tacocat, because it's a palindrome, other palindromes are lion oil, a nut for a jar of tuna,
mr owl ate my metal worm, go dog, evil olive, never odd or even, and racecar. Palindromes are words that are the same
forwards and backwards. Some names are palindromes too, like Ana, Anna, Ava, Asa, etc.
