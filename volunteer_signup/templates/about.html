                <h3>The Wellesley Girls Who Code have worked very hard to make this site for you!</h3>
                <h2>Golden Narwhals in the making</h2>
                <h3>The making of this site wasn't easy. There were several annoying bugs and errors we have encountered while making and testing it.<br> Actually, no site is easy to make, no matter how "default" it looks. It takes a long time, and a lot of effort to make it, but the results are definitly worth it! The Wellesley Girls Who Code have made many pages on this site, including the about, home page, sign in, sign up, etc.</h3>
                <h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
                <h3>This site was created to help the people who are organizing events that require volunteers, and the people who want to sign up for those events.</h3>
                <h2>What is Girls Who Code?</h2>
                <h3>Girls Who Code is a national non-profit organization leading the movement to inspire, educate, and equip girls with the computing/coding skills to pursue 21st century opportunities. About 20 girls coded this with the help of three adults.</h3>
                <h2>What language is the site coded in?</h2>
                <h3>We used HTML, Python, CSS, and Javascript to make this site for you.</h3>
